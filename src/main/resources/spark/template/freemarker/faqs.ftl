     <p style="margin-left:20em;" align="left"> 1. How do we generate concentrations? </p>

     <div class="content" style="margin-left:23em;" align="left">  We take into account each student's workload preferences,
         whether they want their pathway to be aggressively completed (in the least number of semesters) or not,
         as well as the courses they have received credit for in the past to generate the most optimal concentration!
     </div>

     <p style="margin-left:20em;" align="left"> 2. Where do we get course information? </p>

     <div class="content" style="margin-left:23em;" align="left"> For Brown students we generate pathways by using data
         from <a href = "https://thecriticalreview.org/" class="link"> Critical Review </a> and
         <a href = "https://cab.brown.edu/" class="link"> Courses@Brown. </a> We currently support all
         undergraduate courses!
     </div>

     <p style="margin-left:20em;" align="left"> 3. Can I edit my pathway? </p>

     <div class="content" style="margin-left:23em;" align="left"> We are currently working on implementing pathway edit functionality!
         Stay tuned for more progress on Pathway! </div>
